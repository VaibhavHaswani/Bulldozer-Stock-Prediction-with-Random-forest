Bulldozer Stock Prediction (using Random Forest)
================================================

`(Accomplished with Metric score, i.e among top 25 teams)`


*I found this classic Machine Learning Project to work with, from : https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/*


**Note:** The notebook can take a long time to run totally depending on your machine's computation power as algorithms like `RandomizedSearchCV` are used in the Project.

## Project Environment

"Make sure your working environment is same as in the env.yml if not use the following command to create custom conda environment from env.yml in"-


`>conda env create --file env.yml `
